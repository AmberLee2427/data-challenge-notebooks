[//]: # (Include links to the Nexus login and instructions to get to the workflow notebook once there)

[//]: # (Just a thought, If we have a jupyter kernel open can we run a notebook that's local but access the nexus buckets etc? How does that work?)

[//]: # (Another thought, would it makes sense to duplicate the rges-pit.github.io/docs/_drafts/data_challenge_nexus_help.md ([ ] move this out of drafts) content in this file? Preferably in a way that is somewhat automatic.)
