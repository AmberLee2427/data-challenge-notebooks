The notebooks in this repository were originally authored by Amber Malpas, 
Arjun Murlidhar, Katie Vandorou, Katarzyna Kruszyńska, and Ali Crisp, but 
rely heavily on the resources provided by the package creators. They are 
provided by the RGES-PIT to encourage community engagement in preparation 
for the Roman Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey. If you adapt or build upon 
these notebooks, please acknowledge the original authors and the RGES-PIT. 
For researchers using these materials in publications or teaching, a citation 
to the relevant Roman mission papers and to the tools you use is recommended.
