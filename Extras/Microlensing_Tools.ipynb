    "### What data are used in this notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook primarily uses lightcurves from the [2018 WFIRST Data Challenge](https://www.microlensing-source.org/data-challenge/). The data will be either fetched from an s3 bucket or [cloned](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and sorted in later sections, depending on your environment. Because the 2018 WFIRST Data Challenge concluded in 2018, we can make full use of the [parameter \"truths\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parameter#:~:text=parameter%20describes%20the-,true%20value,-calculated%20from%20the) for each event to verify our fitting processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of two lightcurve files for each event or star, representing the data from Roman's `W149` and `Z087` filters. The files are in ASCII format with the columns BJD, Aperture_Magnitude and Error, and follow the file-naming convention: `ulwdc1_nnn_[W149/Z087].txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "Supplementary files were also provided including `wfirst_ephemeris.txt`, which contains the `BJD` and 3D spacecraft location within the solar system. Information was provided on the surface-brightness color relation for `Z087-W149` to enable lens masses to be determined where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that in the simulated data, the inertial frame of reference was defined with the $x$-axis increasing from the binary primary lens object towards the secondary (less massive) lens object at `t0`, the time of closest approach to the primary lens. If viewed from the solar system barycenter, the inertial frame moves at the relative velocity `vlens_CoM - vobserver(t0)`. The inclination of the orbit is a counter-clockwise rotation about the $x$-axis. $\\alpha$ is the angle that the source trajectory made with the $x$-axis (if parallax was 0). Where finite source effects were significant, a linear limb darkening law was applied.\n",

    "When fitting Roman data with `MulensModel`, we need to make a minor adjustment to our model for data that is not ground based. In `MulensModel` this simply means adding the following keyword to the data object initialization: `ephemerides_file=PATH_TO_THE_FILE`.\n",

That should speen up our fits too. If we wanted to find the color of the source star at a later date we could fit just the flux parameters and leave the microlensing-model parameters fixed (as described in [this notebook](https://amberlee2427.github.io/TheMicrolensersGuideToTheGalaxy/Solved/SingleLens.html)) using a linear regression, which would take a fraction of a second per event."

    "Let's jump straight in to simple single lens model that includes the finite source effect (ρ parameter) and parallax. These are important higher-order effects for breaking the microlensing mass-distance degeneracy, so it is highly useful to know how to include them in your models. Functionally, the finite source effect smooths over sharp features in the light-curve and parallax changes the apparent trajectory of the source (relative to the lens) as the observer moves around the solar-system. In practice, parallax is oftem not well constrained from a single observer over typical event timescales. \n",

    "We've demonstrated several key higher-order effects in microlensing, throughout this `MulensModel` section, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Finite Source Effects (ρ):**\n",
    "- Important when the source star is resolved\n",
    "- Provides constraints on the lens mass and distance\n",
    "- Essential for accurate parameter estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallax Effects (π_E):**\n",
    "- Crucial for space-based observations\n",
    "- Enables mass and distance measurements\n",
    "- Breaks degeneracies in lens properties\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Effects (not demonstrated):**\n",
    "- **Lens Orbital Motion:** Changes in binary lens separation over time (often highly degenerate with parllax effect)\n",
    "- **Xallarap:** Source orbital motion effects\n",
    "- **Limb Darkening:** Non-uniform source brightness (rarely well constrained). We have used `gamma` (linear limb-darkening) in this section, but it has always been set to the simulation truth, 0.0; i.e., uniform radial source brightness.\n",
    "- **Astrometry:** Position measurements during events (sparsley obtained prior to Roman). Not yet supported in `MulensModel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modelling Best Practices:**\n",
    "- Start with simple models and add complexity gradually\n",
    "- Use MCMC for complex parameter spaces\n",
    "- Consider known degeneracies\n",
    "- Consider computational efficiency for large surveys\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is popclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "**popclass** is a Python package developed by LLNL (lead: Peter McGill) for *probabilistic classification* of the lens in a gravitational microlensing event. It bridges the gap between event posteriors (from light curve modeling) and population synthesis simulations of the Milky Way, allowing you to infer the probability that a given event was caused by a star, white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key use:** Given posterior samples (e.g., from MulensModel, pyLIMA, or any Bayesian fit) and a Galactic population model, popclass computes the probability that the lens belongs to each class.\n",
    "- **Why use it?** It enables population-level inference, e.g., identifying likely black hole events, and is designed for the era of large surveys (Roman, Rubin)."

    "- **Method:** Uses Bayesian importance sampling to compare the event's posterior to simulated populations, computing the probability for each lens class.\n",

    "### 4.4 Population Models\n",
    "\n",
    "popclass comes with several pre-built population models (from PopSyCLE), e.g.:\n",

    "- `popsycle_singles_raithel18`\n",
    "- `popsycle_singles_spera15`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also load your own models in ASDF format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible parameter spaces:** Use any set of event parameters (e.g., `tE`, `piE`, `thetaE`, `blend_fraction`).\n",
    "- **Custom population models:** Supply your own simulation data in the required format.\n",
    "- **Uncertainty quantification:** Includes a \"None\" class to flag events not well explained by the model.\n",
    "- **ArviZ and PyMultiNest integration:** For handling posteriors from common Bayesian tools.\n",
    "- **Plotting:** Built-in tools for visualizing classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.6 Best Practices & Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameter consistency:** Ensure your posterior and population model use the same parameterization (e.g., both in `log10(tE)`, not `tE`).\n",
    "- **Prior density:** Must match the parameter space of the population model (apply Jacobian if transforming variables).\n",
    "- **Model completeness:** If your event is outside the simulated parameter space, the \"None\" class will help flag this.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** Probabilities are only as good as the population model and the event posterior.\n",
